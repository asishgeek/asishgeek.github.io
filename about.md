I am a 4th year PhD student in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) department at Purdue,
advised by Prof. [Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/).
I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and using Machine Learning to solve interesting problems in
computational biology and other application domains. I also collaborate with Prof. Ananth Grama, 
Prof. Saurabh Bagchi from the ECE department and Prof. Somali Chaterji.

Previously, I obtained my Master in Computer Science and Engineering degree from [Texas A&M](https://www.tamu.edu)
and briefly worked as a software development engineer in the demand forecasting team at Amazon, Seattle.
