I am a 4th year PhD student in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) department at Purdue,
advised by Prof. [Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/). My research focuses on developing
efficient algorithms, with provable guarantess, for various statistical and machine learning problems. Recently,
I have focussed on the problem of learning graphical models and graphical games from data. I am also interested in
using machine learning techniques to solve problems in computational biology and other application domains.

Previously, I obtained my Master in Computer Science and Engineering degree from [Texas A&M](https://www.tamu.edu)
and briefly worked as a software development engineer in the demand forecasting team at Amazon, Seattle.
