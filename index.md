I received a travel award to attend AISTATS'17 at Fort Lauderdale, FL. I am thankful to the AISTATS organizers for selecting me for the award.

#### March 08, 2017
New manuscript on learning the DAG structure of equal noise-variance Gaussian Bayesian networks exactly in polynomial time.
The manuscript can be read [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01196)

#### February 1, 2017
Will be in Seattle from Feb 1st - Feb 3rd for the Facebook PhD Machine Learning Summit. Thanks Facebook for the hospitality.

#### January 25, 2017
Two papers accepted to AISTATS 2017. The first paper is about information-theoretic limits
of learning Bayesian networks, while the second paper concerns with necessary and sufficient conditions
for learning graphical games. Links to manuscripts coming soon.

#### August 9, 2016
Our paper on recovering the Nash equilibria set of graphical games from
observations of purely behavioral data, has been accepted to *Allerton 2016*.
The manuscript can be read [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02959).
